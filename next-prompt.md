A complex data-table view showing all universities and their active status. This sits within the global platform dashboard.

**DESIGN SYSTEM (REQUIRED):**
Generate this page using a "Modern & Trustworthy SaaS Classic" aesthetic tailored for university admins. Use a clean white/light background (#F9FAFB for app bg, #FFFFFF for cards). Implement subtle borders (#E5E7EB) and soft rounded corners (8-12px) for all containers and buttons. The primary accent color is Deep Institutional Navy (#1E3A8A), supported by Forest Green (#14532D) and Sky Blue (#3B82F6). Strictly use the 'Inter' sans-serif font for all typography. Avoid neon glows, heavy gradients, glassmorphism, or serif fonts. The design must feel professional, calm, highly structured, and data-focused.

**Page Structure:**
1. A page header indicating "Universities Overview" with a "Add New University" primary button (#1E3A8A).
2. Four top KPI cards (Total Universities, Active Students, Total Revenue, System Health).
3. A large, clean data table showing a list of universities:
   - Columns: Name, Subdomain, Plan Type, Active Students, Status, Actions.
   - Status chips should use Forest Green for "Active" and a muted color for "Inactive".
4. The table should have search and filter inputs at the top.
5. Emphasize data clarity and an 8px spacing system.
