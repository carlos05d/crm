---
A settings and configuration page for a specific university (Tenant Admin Dashboard). This sits within the global platform dashboard but is scoped to the specific university.

**DESIGN SYSTEM (REQUIRED):**
Generate this page using a "Modern & Trustworthy SaaS Classic" aesthetic tailored for university admins. Use a clean white/light background (#F9FAFB for app bg, #FFFFFF for cards). Implement subtle borders (#E5E7EB) and soft rounded corners (8-12px) for all containers and buttons. The primary accent color is Deep Institutional Navy (#1E3A8A), supported by Forest Green (#14532D) and Sky Blue (#3B82F6). Strictly use the 'Inter' sans-serif font for all typography. Avoid neon glows, heavy gradients, glassmorphism, or serif fonts. The design must feel professional, calm, highly structured, and data-focused.

**Page Structure:**
1. A page header indicating "University Settings" with a "Save Changes" primary button (#1E3A8A) at the top right.
2. A two-column layout:
   - **Left Column (Navigation):** A vertical list of settings categories (e.g., General Information, Branding, Departments, Connectors, Billing). The active item should be highlighted with a Deep Institutional Navy border.
   - **Right Column (Main Content - General Info):** 
     - A Card containing form inputs for: University Name, Subdomain, Primary Contact Email, Phone.
     - A section within the card for "Branding" showing a logo upload area and a primary color hex input.
3. Ensure generous whitespace (8px grid) and clear separation between form groups.
4. Add secondary buttons for "Cancel" or "Reset to Default" next to primary actions.
