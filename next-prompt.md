A clean, trusting authentication page for internal users (Agents, University Admins, Super Admins) to access the CRM platform.

**DESIGN SYSTEM (REQUIRED):**
Generate this page using a "Modern & Trustworthy SaaS Classic" aesthetic tailored for university admins. Use a clean white/light background (#F9FAFB for app bg, #FFFFFF for cards). Implement subtle borders (#E5E7EB) and soft rounded corners (8-12px) for all containers and buttons. The primary accent color is Deep Institutional Navy (#1E3A8A), supported by Forest Green (#14532D) and Sky Blue (#3B82F6). Strictly use the 'Inter' sans-serif font for all typography. Avoid neon glows, heavy gradients, glassmorphism, or serif fonts. The design must feel professional, calm, highly structured, and data-focused.

**Page Structure:**
1. A centered, clean authentication card on a light #F9FAFB background.
2. The card should have the university or platform logo placeholder at the top.
3. Form fields for Email Address and Password with clear, accessible labels.
4. A primary "Deep Institutional Navy" button to "Sign In".
5. A subtle "Forgot Password?" link.
6. A footer indicating the system is secure and for authorized personnel only.
