# Project Context & Next Steps 🎯

**Date:** Feb 21, 2026

## What We Did (Current State)
We successfully architected and built the core Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the University SaaS CRM! Here is everything functioning in the repo right now:

1. **Database Architecture & Security:** 
   - Configured `Supabase` with tables for `universities`, `profiles`, `departments`, `kanban_stages`, and `leads`.
   - Enabled and configured strict Row-Level Security (RLS) policies enforcing multi-tenant isolation.
   - Wrote SQL seed scripts to inject mock universities.

2. **Subdomain Routing System:**
   - Next.js Edge Middleware (`middleware.ts`) that correctly intercepts domains like `harvard.platform.com` or `localhost:3000/harvard` and routes them to the public tenant pages while keeping the main app safely guarded.

3. **Authentication & Roles:**
   - Fully functioning Login and Signup flow (`/login`) using `@supabase/ssr` server actions and `zod` schema validation.
   - Smart Dashboard Routing: Your login automatically redirects you to either the Super Admin, Tenant Admin, or Agent Kanban view depending on your exact database `role`!

4. **SaaS UI Foundations (Built with shadcn/ui & Tailwind):**
   - **Global Landing Page:** A gorgeous B2B marketing site to sell the CRM.
   - **Super Admin Dashboard:** A global view directory of all university tenants.
   - **Tenant Admin Dashboard:** A settings dashboard for a specific university to manage staff and branding.
   - **Agent Kanban Board:** A drag-and-drop workspace (`@dnd-kit/core`) for tracking leads across pipeline stages.
   - **Dynamic Tenant Public Form:** An exposed lead capture form for a university (`/[domain]/page.tsx`) that successfully takes visitor info and injects a real `lead` row strictly assigned to that university's first Kanban stage!

## What We DID NOT Do (Future Work / Next Session)
Our UI is completely flushed out, but much of the internal platform data logic inside the dashboards are still strictly visual mockups. When you return, focus on wiring the Supabase real data into the UI:

1. **Live Data Fetching (Dashboards):** 
   - The Super Admin and Tenant Admin dashboards are currently mapping over hardcoded mock arrays (e.g., `universities = [...]`). You need to replace this by querying Supabase cleanly on page load.
   
2. **Kanban Board Live Leads:**
   - The Agent Kanban currently maps `const [leads] = useState(INITIAL_LEADS)`. You need to fetch the actual leads from the Supabase DB matching the Agent's `university_id`.
   - *Bonus:* Wire up `supabase_realtime` so the board updates LIVE if someone submits the public form!

3. **The Tenant Settings Form (Saving):**
   - Make the "Update Settings" button inside the Tenant Admin dashboard actually perform a SQL `UPDATE` to modify the university's `branding_json` and name.

4. **User Invites & Onboarding:**
   - We hacked account creation using a generic "Sign Up as Fake Super Admin" button on the login screen for testing. 
   - You need to build a real flow where Tenant Admins can invite new `agents` via an email link (using Supabase Auth Admin API).

5. **Lead Scoring & Details Modal:**
   - We added "Scores" and a "View Details" button to the Kanban Cards visually. You need to build the side-drawer `<Sheet>` component to actually pop open when you click "View Details" so agents can add notes, emails, and change scores.

## Known Gotchas & Bugs We Encountered Today
1. **Empty Database Validations:** The public tenant form (`/[domain]`) threw errors initially because `zod` and our Supabase queries expected valid `university_id` and `kanban_stage` records to exist in the DB.
2. **Row-Level Security (RLS) Blockers:** The default Supabase RLS is very strict. It initially blocked:
   - Anonymous (public) visitors from submitting forms into the `leads` table.
   - Newly signed up users from inserting records into the `profiles` table.
   *We fixed this through the `20260102000000_seed_and_rls_fixes.sql` migration, but keep an eye on RLS as you build more features!*

## 🎨 Upcoming Design Update
Tomorrow, a `.zip` file containing an existing CRM will be provided. We will use this as a reference point for **inspiration and theming**. Our goal will be to inherit the best parts of that CRM's aesthetic and integrate it into our current `shadcn/ui` architecture.

*Take a well-deserved rest! When you come back, open this file to hit the ground running. Everything is nicely scoped and the hard foundational work is 100% complete!*
